<H1>Channel Player for Youtube channels</H1>

This application will play Youtube videos from a predefined set of channels.<p/>
The channels are identified by "handles" in Youtube terms:<p/>
Channel URL: https://www.youtube.com/@NaukaPRO <p/>
Handle is "@NaukaPRO".

Since this application was built for my own child, initial channel list is filled with channels that fit to him specifically.

The main goal of this application is to provide child with only approved kind of videos. Assuming each listed channel is consistent and safe, there should be no way to switch to one of prohibited kinds of video.

Notice that defenition of what is "safe" in any particular situation is extremely vague and should not be assumed ahead of time.

# Name of your GitHub Actions workflow.
name: Android CI Build

# Controls when the workflow will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch.
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events targeted at the "main" branch.
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab in GitHub.
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build".
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the correct JDK version. Your project uses Java 17.
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin' # A popular, open-source distribution of OpenJDK.
          cache: 'gradle' # Caches Gradle dependencies for faster builds.

      # Step 3: Grant execute permissions to the gradlew script.
      # This is crucial for security and ensures the script can be run.
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x ./gradlew

      # Step 4: Run the 'assembleRelease' Gradle task to build the release APK/AAB.
      # 'assembleRelease' builds the release version of your app.
      # Use 'assembleDebug' if you want to build the debug version instead.
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew assembleRelease

      # Step 5 (Optional): Upload the build artifact (the APK).
      # This allows you to download the generated APK directly from the GitHub Actions run results.
      - name: Upload Release APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: channel-player-release-apk # The name of the artifact to be downloaded.
          path: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk # The path to the file to upload.
